# RC4-Net - .Net Standart 2.0 SymmetricAlgorithm
RC4-Net is a .Net Standart 2.0 library that adds support for encrypting/decrypting using the symmetric RC4 algorithm in the .NET environment. The classes and methods used in the library are inherited from standard .NET cryptographic interfaces such as: SymmetricAlgorithm and ICryptoTransform. This will allow you to work with the library analogue, the built-in encryption/decryption algorithm, and also to fully use streams.

Sorry for my English :-)

## There are 3 projects in the solution:
* **RC4-Net** - RC4 library itself (.Net Standart 2.0)
* **RC4-Demo** - application demonstration (.Net Framework 4.7.2)
* **RC4-Test** - a few of simple tests (.Net Framework 4.7.2)
