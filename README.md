# RC4Net - .Net Standart 2.0 SymmetricAlgorithm
RC4Net is a .Net Standart 2.0 library that adds support for encrypting/decrypting using the symmetric RC4 algorithm in the .NET environment. The classes and methods used in the library are inherited from standard .NET cryptographic interfaces such as: SymmetricAlgorithm and ICryptoTransform. This will allow you to work with the library analogue, the built-in encryption/decryption algorithm, and also to fully use streams.
